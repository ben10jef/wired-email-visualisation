# Brief summary

| Widgets    | Description |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Highlights**                       | Overall Summary of email campaign       |
| **Email highlight [Days vs Time]**   | Heatchart showing peak time of email sent        |
| **Email engagement by day of week**  | Performance metrics during all the days in the week |
| **Percentage of email sent** |  Analysis of best time to send email |
| **Email engagement by hour of day** | Performance metrics on an hourly basis |
| **User table**  |  List of Users with their curresponding details    |

If I had more time, I could:
* give a visual idea of the best time to send emails accross various business.   
* implement login flow
* have added more Javascript codes (Focused more on visualisation)
* implement redux
* dive deeper on the data and create more visualisation
* have added user Interaction
* added more react hooks 
* avoided static datas

Had to take more time on to visualizing the data and creating them
